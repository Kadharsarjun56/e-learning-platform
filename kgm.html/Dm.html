Be it running the banks or getting food from an eatery home-delivered, Information Technology has become a part and parcel of our lives.

  <h1>SEO</h1>
  <p>SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, SEO means the process of improving your website to increase its visibility in Google, Microsoft Bing, and other search engines whenever people search for:

    Products you sell.
    Services you provide.
    Information on topics in which you have deep expertise and/or experience.
    The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to be found and clicked on. </p>

  <h1>Social Media Marketing</h1>
  <p>Social media marketing is the use of social media platforms to connect with your audience to build your brand, increase sales, and drive website traffic. This involves publishing great content on your social media profiles, listening to and engaging your followers, analyzing your results, and running social media advertisements.
   The major social media platforms (at the moment) are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, and Snapchat.
     There are also a range of social media management tools that help businesses to get the most out of the social media platforms listed above. For example, Buffer is a platform of social media management tools, which can help you achieve success with your social media marketing. Whether you want to build a brand or grow your business, we want to help you succeed.</p>

Whenever we mention “SEM,” it will be because we’re referring to both SEO (organic search) and PPC (paid search). 
    If you’re curious about the history behind how “SEM” came to mean “PPC” at the exclusion of SEO, you can dig deeper into these articles:</p>
