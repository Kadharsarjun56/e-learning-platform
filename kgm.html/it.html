      <h1 class="display-4">IT Courses</h1>
      <p class="lead">In today’s world Information Technology (IT) has become the most fundamental need for proper functioning of human society. Be it running the banks or getting food from an eatery home-delivered, Information Technology has become a part and parcel of our lives. This dependence on Information Technology has given rise to the demand of learning and further innovation in this field as a result of which it has become one of the most popular fields in education and career. You can find IT specialisation in every branch of education, from IT & Software, Engineering, Aviation and Medicine to MBA and even Hospitality. In this technological era, the best career option for students in the present and immediate future is to become an Information Technology (IT) professional.

        Eligibility for Information Technology courses generally includes having completed their higher secondary education, such as completed class 10+2, with a focus on science or mathematics. Candidates are often required to have a minimum aggregate score in their qualifying examinations (50 percent in general), and some universities or institutes might specify additional subject requirements.</p>

  <h2>Software Development</h2>
<p>Software development refers to a set of computer science activities that are dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying, and supporting software.
Software itself is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. It is independent of hardware and makes computers programmable. There are three basic types:
System software to provide core functions such as operating systems, disk management, utilities, hardware management and other operational necessities.
Programming software to give programmers tools such as text editors, compilers, linkers, debuggers, and other tools to create code.
Application software (applications or apps)</p>
<hr>

<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
<p>Prominent cloud service providers include Amazon web services AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc. These cloud providers are helping businesses take public, private, hybrid, and community cloud computing initiatives.
  The vast adoption of cloud services by the business has led to various versions of cloud development according to their business feasibility.
  The main idea is to use cloud resources instead of physical on-premises hardware, servers, etc.
  Businesses are able to integrate the latest cloud technologies in their web apps and other cloud-based solutions by using cloud services like multiple remote data centers, development tools, operating systems, etc. through a cloud platform as a service, software as a service, or infrastructure as a service.</p>

  <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
  <p>Network security: This involves measures to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data as it is transmitted across or accessed from networks. Techniques include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and VPNs.
    Information security: This focuses on protecting data from unauthorized access, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability (otherwise known as the “CIA triad”). Protection measures employ both digital methods like cryptography and non-digital methods like the physical security of data centers and server rooms.
    Endpoint security: This concentrates on securing endpoints or “end-user” devices like computers, mobile devices, and laptops. Tools used include antivirus and antimalware software.
    Cloud security: This area focuses on protecting data stored in cloud-based systems, which are increasingly relied upon by businesses and individuals.
    Application security: This ensures that software applications are secure from threats. It includes the use of software, hardware, and procedural methods to protect applications from external threats.
    Identity and access management (IAM): This ensures that only authorized individuals can access certain resources, using tools like multi-factor authentication.</p>
