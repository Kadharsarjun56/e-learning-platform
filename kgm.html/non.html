Be it running the banks or getting food from an eatery home-delivered, Information Technology has become a part and parcel of our lives. This dependence on Information Technology has given rise to the demand of learning and further innovation in this field as a result of which it has become one of the most popular fields in education and career.

  <h1>Data analysts</h1>
  <p>Even with years of professional experience working with data, the term "data analysis" still sets off a panic button in my soul.

   <h1>QA Tester</h1>
  <p>Quality assurance testing is a process that ensures an organization delivers the best products or services possible. QA aims to deliver consistent results through a set of standardized procedures, which means organizations also need to make sure their processes for achieving the desired results hit specific quality benchmarks.
In brief, you might say QA includes all activities centered around implementing standards and procedures associated with ensuring software meets certain requirements before it’s released to the public. The key thing to keep in mind is that QA doesn’t involve the actual testing of products. Instead, it focuses on the procedures to ensure the best outcome. QA activities are ultimately process-oriented.</p>
