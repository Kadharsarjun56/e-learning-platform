  <h1>Designer</h1>
  <p>AutoCAD is the backbone of mechanical design. Its precision, versatility, and industry-wide recognition make it indispensable for mechanical engineers. With AutoCAD skills, you can create detailed 2D and 3D designs, collaborate seamlessly, and improve your productivity.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Fluid Mech</h1>
<p>Fluid mechanics is the branch of physics concerned with the mechanics of fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) and the forces on them.[1]: 3  It has applications in a wide range of disciplines, including mechanical, aerospace, civil, chemical, and biomedical engineering, as well as geophysics, oceanography, meteorology, astrophysics, and biology.
  It can be divided into fluid statics, the study of fluids at rest; and fluid dynamics, the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion.[1]: 3  It is a branch of continuum mechanics, a subject which models matter without using the information that it is made out of atoms; that is, it models matter from a macroscopic viewpoint rather than from microscopic.</p>
  <hr>
  <h1>Robotic mech</h1>
  <p>This diploma program features co‑operative education with six academic terms at the College and three work terms in industry. Studies combine theoretical knowledge with applied skills in the control of robotic and automated equipment using electronics, programmable automation controllers, computers, hydraulics and pneumatics. In addition, the program focuses on the development of skills in 3D CAD, mechanical technology, electric motors, servo-mechanisms, advanced robotics, industrial automation, and safety standards. Emphasis is placed on effective techniques for designing, modifying, installing, testing, maintaining, repairing, and troubleshooting equipment and systems.</p>
