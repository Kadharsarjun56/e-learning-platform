<h1>Our origins</h1>
<p>
    Growing up in a small Turkish village, Skille founder Eren Bali had few educational opportunities — until he got a computer. Fueled by his dream to compete in mathematics, he used the internet to learn his way to a silver medal in the International Math Olympiad.
    After learning online changed his life, Eren partnered with co-founders Oktay Caglar and Gagan Biyani to achieve a common goal: to make quality education accessible to all.</h1>
